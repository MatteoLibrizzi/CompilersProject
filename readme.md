# Compilers Project
### Find the assignment document in the repo

This is the project I completed for the subject "compilers" in the third year of my bachelor in computer science.

Run with this command:
```for FILE in resources/*; do printf "Input File: %s\n\n" $FILE; ./parser < $FILE; printf "\n----------\n"; done```
